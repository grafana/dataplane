# Contract

Each dataplane contract represents a unique combination of dataframe type and data frame version along with meta data such as contract stage.

Each dataplane contract comes with one or more number of rules. These rules are code representation of contracts defined in [dataplane contract docs](https://grafana.com/developers/dataplane).

Each data plane contact corresponding to individual data frame type should contain specific contracts for each versions.
