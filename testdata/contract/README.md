# Test and Example Data

Unless correcting mistakes, do not change existing examples as this may break outside tests. (However, extending exampleInfo or updating the summary is permitted)

Directory format is:
 - kind/format/version/collection/example_file.json

Additional information for tests is kept in the custom meta data of the first frame in the "exampleInfo" property.
