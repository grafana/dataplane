# Data frames

Grafana supports a variety of different data sources, each with its own data model. To make this possible, Grafana consolidates the query results from each of these data sources into one unified data structure called a **data frame**. A data frame is a collection of fields, where each field corresponds to a column. Each field, in turn, consists of a collection of values and metadata, such as the data type of those values.

Refer to [Data frames](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/key-concepts/data-frames) in the Plugins developer documentation for an overview of data frames.
